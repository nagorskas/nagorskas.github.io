				<b>(Not) To Pass By (2020–2023)</b> is an analog landscape photography series.
				The series portrays landscapes that are empty and mundane, something that is
				rarely seen in the genre. These landscapes can be seen in the countryside of
				Lithuania and are encountered near transit roads. As such, they are most often
				just passed by, either on foot or by car, and rarely pull the attention of the
				passerby. The series aims to invite the viewer to take a look at these seldom
				looked-at views and find something interesting about them, something to help
				the viewer create their own story, their own aesthetic experience. This experience
				is divided into three parts, each of them distinct in style and function. <br>
				<b>(Not) To Pass By III (2022–2023)</b>, also known as <b>To Stay</b>, unlike the
				previous two parts, is a piece of video art. While the shots are still static,
				reminiscent of the photographs seen prior, the background and the landscapes
				portrayed now have subtle movement that requires the viewer to take a longer
				and more concentrated look at the image. Mirroring the viewer is a figure
				standing in the middle of the landscape, looking away from the camera and
				towards the landscape, acting as a visual anchor and representing the viewer
				in the image itself.
